# Project 14 Front End Developer OpenClassrooms

## Title

### Pass a jQuery library to React

## Context

I work for the technology department of a large financial company, WealthHealth.
This company uses an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee records. The app is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to massive bugs and increased internal complaints. The development team has been struggling for some time now to upgrade the app.

## Assignment

- Convert the entire HRNet project to React.
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to React. Replace the 3 remaining jQuery plugins with React components that you will code yourself, or that you can import from existing libraries if you are short of time.
- Perform Lighthouse benchmarks comparing old and new app
- This is the repository of the application on JQuery [WealthHeath] (https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end.git)

## Technologies

- JS
- CSS
